Felipe Alcântara is a brazilian singer and songwritter.

As he shifted his career, he needed a website that reflected his new phase as a solo performer.

Despite the dark classic tones of his branding, Felipe is a very energetic guy and he wanted to let this side of him shine throughout the website.

With that in mind, we developed a series of subtle animations that you can find while interacting with the site, including a mouse-sensitive link made with SVG mask for the header of the home page.



<p class="codepen" data-height="549" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="camila_waz" data-slug-hash="zEQwzP" style="height: 549px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="SVG Mask With Link">

The website was created to serve as a hub for Felipe's musical career. He wanted a place to concentrate all the official information and communications channels.
