Lagoa Shopping is a small shopping complex in the heart of my hometown, João Pessoa, Paraíba, Brazil.

Working with the Studio Dois Cafés, I created their website. The goal of the project was to design an easy to use responsive interface that could capture leads of shop owners (interested in the business opportunity) and familiarise the visitors with the most relevant information about the complex.

The project started with the outline of the sitemap, the definition of the content required and throughout this process, we identified a potential opportunity to create a store directory page.

With the necessary information in hand, I then designed a wireframe for the two high priority pages - the homepage and the store directory page. 

During this exploration phase, I defined the content to be displayed on the homepage with sections to appeal to both personas and decided on the information architecture of the store directory page that included a complex filtering feature.

The final deliverables of this project consisted of: 
* Information Architecture report
* Wireframes
* High Fidelity UI Design 
* Development (WordPress)
