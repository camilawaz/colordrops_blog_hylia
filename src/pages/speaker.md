I'm interested in taking over a few speaking engagements for 2020. If you believe I'd be a good fit for your event or meetup, please send me more info via email (*hello\[at]camilawaz\[dot]com*).

Due to the current circumstances around travel, I'd be happy to discuss any opportunity to join online events or contribute to content pieces like blog posts or podcasts. Feel free to contact me on the email above and stay safe.
