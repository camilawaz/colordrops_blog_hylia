---
Camila Waz is a Brazilian web designer and developer, now based in Dublin - Ireland.

Her passion for content brought her into the world of tech where she got to know Front End Technologies and Design by building blog themes.

Using this knowledge she worked as a Freelancer for a number of years helping entrepreneurs and bloggers to get their message (and their websites!) out there. At the same time, she contributed to her local tech community organising events, meetups and training sessions for new developers.

Now she works as a UI/UX Web Developer and is a co-organiser for DublinCSS - a community with monthly meetups that welcomes all developers, designers and curious individuals, regardless of experience level, to discuss and learn about the latest and standard CSS tips and techniques.
