Hey, I'm Camila Waz. A designer and developer based in Dublin, Ireland.

I aim to work at the intersection between design and front-end development using UX design principles in alignment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and libraries) to bring creative and scalable solutions into the world wide web.

It all started more than 10 years ago when my passion for creating content brought me into the world of tech where I got to know Front End Technologies and Design by building blog themes. I've worked as a Freelancer for many years helping entrepreneurs and bloggers to get their message (and their websites!) out there.

I graduated in Communication in Digital Media, back in Brazil, where I had the opportunity to develop myself as a multidisciplinary professional. I'm a NN/g certified UX professional (Verify - Code: 1032376) and have also pursued other qualifications focused on User Experience as well as Adobe Creative Suite training.

I'm currently working as UI/UX Web Developer at Net Affinity and co-organising DublinCSS - a community with monthly meetups that welcomes all developers and designers, regardless of experience level, to discuss and learn about the latest and standard CSS techniques.

Last but not least, I am someone who loves to share what I know and learn more every day.
