Hey, I'm Camila Waz. A designer and developer based in Dublin, Ireland.

I aim to work at the intersection between design and front-end development using UX design principles in alignment with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (and libraries) to bring creative and scalable solutions into the world wide web.

<div class="about-image" style="float:right;margin: 1em;"><img src="/images/camila-waz-profile.png"/></div>

It all started more than 10 years ago when my passion for creating content brought me into the world of tech where I got to know Front End Technologies and Design by building blog themes. I've worked as a Freelancer for many years helping entrepreneurs and bloggers to get their message (and their websites!) out there.

I graduated in Communication in Digital Media, back in Brazil, where I had the opportunity to develop myself as a multidisciplinary professional. I'm a NN/g certified UX professional ([Verify](https://www.nngroup.com/ux-certification/verify/) - Code: 1032376) and have also pursued other qualifications focused on User Experience as well as Adobe Creative Suite training.

I'm currently working as UX Design Engineer at Net Affinity and co-organising DublinCSS - a community meetup that welcomes all developers and designers, regardless of experience level, to discuss and learn about the latest and standard CSS techniques.

Last but not least, I am someone who loves to share what I know and learn more every day.
