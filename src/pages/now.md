At this moment, I'm:

* Working at Net Affinity as a UX Design Engineer
* Self isolating (since March 15)
* Attending [Smashing Magazine online workshops](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/) 
* Sharing explorations on lettering and illustration on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/colordrops_)
* Sharing code explorations on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/camila_waz)
* Trying to find extra time to work on my personal blog (as every other decent person on the internet :P)
