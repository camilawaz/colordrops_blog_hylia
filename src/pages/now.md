November 5th, 2019

At this moment, I'm:

* Working at Net Affinity as a UI/UX Web Developer
* Sharing explorations on lettering and illustration on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/colordrops_)
* Sharing code explorations on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/camila_waz)
* Trying to find extra time to work on my personal blog (as every other decent person on the internet :P)
* Very anxious about the NN Group UX Conference I'm attending in London soon (Nov 15th)
